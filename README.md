# Abstract
Determination of a Depth of Anaesthesia (DOA) index is important for enhancing surgical safety by observing patientsâ€™ Anaesthetic levels in real time. This study is focused on developing a new DOA index by utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering. The general objective of this work is to design a robust model for DoA classification, which would be applicable for monitoring and maintaining optimum anesthetic administration to reduce side effects during surgical procedures. This study leverages datasets provided by Well Hospital, which are comprised of several feature sets derived from EEG signals. The results of the clustering methods have been compared with known labels. And the two clustering methods have been evaluated using evaluation metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, according to which k-means clustering is more efficient and scalable than hierarchical clustering when determining the DOA level.
